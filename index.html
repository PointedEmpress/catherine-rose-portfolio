          <p>
            Thank you for viewing my page. I’m an aspiring full stack developer with ~2 years of experience working across both application and presentation layers. 
            I’ve built and deployed applications and microservices on IBM Cloud, and I’m a dedicated user of IBM Watson Services, including Watson Assistant, Natural Language Understanding, and Sentiment Analyzer. 
            I hold a BFA degree and bring 11 years of hospitality experience, which has shaped my strong communication skills, adaptability, and user-centric mindset—qualities I now apply to every stage of the development process.

          Working with Ms. Rose has been an awesome experience. 
          She is highly knowledgable and always goes the extra step to make sure everything is right. 
          For any future projects that need her expertise I would definitely want to work with her again.

          I had worked along with Catherine during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development. 
          She is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain.

          Working with Ms. Rose on my streambot was a dream. She was incredibly professional and efficient. All coorespondance was had in a timely fashion.
          I have even referred her to other content creators simply because of the great service.
          She can get the job done without hassle.

          Ms. Catherine was hired as a freelancer to create two websites. Both were created within projected time and overall communication was a breeze. We had no worries about making out deadline because Catherine made sure that we stay ahead of our busy schedules. She is certainly a valuable asset to any team.

            Catherine Rose has exceeded every expectation that proceeded her. Her work ethic, time management, and communication between all teams makes her a force to be reckoned with. 
            Our team greatly benefitted from the knowlegde and wisdom of Catherine - she brought a sense of purpose and accountablity to the team.
